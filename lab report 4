 For the lab report this week, reproduce the task from above on your own. For each numbered step starting right after the timer (so steps 4-9), take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step. For special characters like <enter> or <tab>, write them in angle brackets with code formatting. Then, summarize the commands you ran and what the effect of those keypresses were.

Step 4: Log into ieng6
ssh cs15lfa23il@ieng6.ucsd.edu Yes <password>


Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)

git clone https://github.com/adhithinm/lab7.git


Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
Bash test.sh


Step 7: Edit the code file to fix the failing test
j l x i 2 <escape> : w q ! <enter> 

Step 8: Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed


Step 9: Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)

Git commit -a 

i Error fixed! <escape> : w q ! <enter>
