Original Post:

Hello,

I'm trying to run a Java program by using the bash script, but I don't know what I'm doing wrong. 
The script is supposed to compile and then run the program, but it's not working. 
Here's the output I'm getting:

```
/mnt/data/run_number_printer.sh: line 3: javac: command not found
/mnt/data/run_number_printer.sh: line 4: java: command not found
```

I'm not sure what the problem is. Can someone help me with it?
